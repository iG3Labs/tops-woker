**Content-Type**: `text/plain`

**Format**: Standard Prometheus exposition format

## Available Metrics

### Counters

| `tops_worker_total_attempts_total` | Counter | Total number of attempts made |
| `tops_worker_successful_attempts_total` | Counter | Total number of successful attempts |
| `tops_worker_failed_attempts_total` | Counter | Total number of failed attempts |

| `tops_worker_signature_errors_total` | Counter | Total number of signature errors |
| `tops_worker_validation_errors_total` | Counter | Total number of validation errors |

### Gauges

| Metric | Type | Description |

| `tops_worker_uptime_seconds` | Gauge | Worker uptime in seconds |
| `tops_worker_consecutive_failures` | Gauge | Number of consecutive failures |
| `tops_worker_success_rate` | Gauge | Success rate as percentage (multiplied by 100) |

### Histograms

| Metric | Type | Description | Buckets |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `tops_worker_attempt_duration_ms` | Histogram | Duration of attempts in milliseconds | 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 |
| `tops_worker_network_latency_ms` | Histogram | Network request latency in milliseconds | 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 |

## Example Prometheus Queries

### Basic Metrics
```promql
# Success rate (divide by 100 to get percentage)
tops_worker_success_rate / 100

# Throughput (attempts per second)
rate(tops_worker_successful_attempts_total[1m])

# Error rate
rate(tops_worker_gpu_errors_total[5m]) + rate(tops_worker_network_errors_total[5m])

# Average attempt duration
histogram_quantile(0.5, tops_worker_attempt_duration_ms_bucket)

# 95th percentile attempt duration
histogram_quantile(0.95, tops_worker_attempt_duration_ms_bucket)

# Uptime in hours
tops_worker_uptime_seconds / 3600
```

### Advanced Queries
```promql
# Success rate over time
rate(tops_worker_successful_attempts_total[5m]) / rate(tops_worker_total_attempts_total[5m]) * 100

# Error percentage
(rate(tops_worker_failed_attempts_total[5m]) / rate(tops_worker_total_attempts_total[5m])) * 100

# Consecutive failures trend
increase(tops_worker_consecutive_failures[5m])

# Performance degradation detection
histogram_quantile(0.95, tops_worker_attempt_duration_ms_bucket) > 1000
```

## Alerting Rules

### Example Prometheus Alerting Rules

```yaml
groups:
  - name: tops-worker
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: (rate(tops_worker_failed_attempts_total[5m]) / rate(tops_worker_total_attempts_total[5m])) * 100 > 5
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High error rate detected"
          description: "Error rate is {{ $value }}%"

      - alert: WorkerDown
        expr: tops_worker_uptime_seconds == 0
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Worker is down"
          description: "Worker has been down for more than 1 minute"

      - alert: HighResponseTime
        expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, tops_worker_attempt_duration_ms_bucket) > 1000
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:

      - alert: ConsecutiveFailures
        expr: tops_worker_consecutive_failures > 10
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The Prometheus metrics implementation consists of:

1. **PrometheusMetrics Struct**: Manages metric registration and updates
2. **Metrics Collection**: Integrates with existing metrics system
3. **HTTP Endpoint**: Exposes metrics in Prometheus format
4. **Real-time Updates**: Metrics are updated during worker operation

### Key Features

- **Thread-safe**: Uses atomic operations for concurrent access
- **Memory efficient**: Minimal overhead for metric collection
- **Real-time**: Metrics are updated immediately during operation
- **Standard compliant**: Follows Prometheus exposition format
- **Comprehensive**: Covers performance, errors, and health metrics

### Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: < 1% performance impact
- **Memory usage**: ~2KB additional memory per worker instance
- **Network**: Metrics endpoint adds negligible network traffic

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Metrics not updating**: Check if `METRICS_ENABLED=1` is set
2. **Endpoint not accessible**: Verify worker is running on port 8082
3. **Prometheus scraping fails**: Check network connectivity and firewall rules
4. **High memory usage**: Monitor metric cardinality and bucket counts

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if metrics endpoint is working
curl http://localhost:8082/prometheus

# Verify worker is running
ps aux | grep tops-worker

# Check worker logs
tail -f worker_output.log

# Test Prometheus scraping
curl -v http://localhost:8082/prometheus
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Labels**: Add worker instance labels for multi-instance deployments
2. **Additional Metrics**: GPU utilization, memory usage, queue depth
3. **Metric Filtering**: Configurable metric inclusion/exclusion
4. **Compression**: Gzip compression for large metric exports
5. **Authentication**: Basic auth for metrics endpoint
6. **Rate Limiting**: Protect metrics endpoint from abuse
